# OTB Tech Test

The task was to produce a HTML, CSS and JavaScript representation of the given `design.png` (included in assets directory) with the following features:

- List sortable by price
- List sortable by star rating
- List sortable by name

Things would have been a nice to have that I did not include:

- modular CSS

Reasoning: css modules are great to work with but the time limit was rather short with the bonfire/fireworks weekend upon us so I went with Tailwind for brevity.

I decided to go with the following stack:

- Vite
- React
- Tailwind
